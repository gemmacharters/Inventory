# Inventory
This is a basic console program. In order to run it you need to download the solution,
build within Visual Studio, then copy a file called inventory.csv into the bin/debug folder
of the TechTest folder, which is the name of the project. 
The output will be created in a file called inventory1.csv and an errorlog will also be created.
The output file should match the brief, but with comma delimiters.
I am hoping to make some modifications to streamline the creation of the csv files, 
and to unit test with NTest but I haven't experience of this, so it may take time.
